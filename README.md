This was a pretty challenging project, but fun.
I enjoyed the challenge of having to create my own functions, and I tried to figure it all out without Googling anything or relying on revisiting resources. It really gave me the opportunity to practice psuedocode and what I learned in the "Problem Solving" lesson. 

I even came up with two separate solutions to this challenge, one using parameters in the playRound function, and one without, but ultimately chose to use the one with parameters, as it's what the lesson recommended. I did however, include the alternate solution below, but commented out.

I cant wait until further into the curriculum to add a GUI to it and have it run in the webpage rather than just the console.
